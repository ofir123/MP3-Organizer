Description: 
Automatically organizes a downloaded MP3 album using 3 steps:
1) Find the album in Amazon or Gracenote by using the band's and album's name.
2) Fill in the missing information - Title, Track number, Genre, Artwork etc.
3) Find lyrics for each song and fill them in as well.
Parts 2 and 3 will use factories (an extractor for each information type,
and a lyrics finder for each lyrics website).

Dependencies:
lxml
pyQt 4 (For the GUI to work)
