Account details for the Amazon API.

In order for the Amazon client to work,
You'll need to change this file's name to 'amazon_account.py' and fill in the following details:
Access key, secret key & associate tag.
You can get all of these by creating an AWS account (and a little help from Google).

Good luck!
